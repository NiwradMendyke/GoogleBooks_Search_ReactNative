In this lesson, we will build an app that allows us to navigate and get data from an HTTP API.  In this lesson, you'll learn how to use StackNavigator from `react-navigation`, how to use lists in React Native, and how to get data from an HTTP API.

React-native app to demonstrate usage of data retrieval from an HTTP API. This app lets the user search through Google's Book API and get previews for books in the catalog. The app generates a random word using a random word API, and populates the initial search screen with a search based off that random word. 
The user can then search for a particular term and upon tapping on a search result, the user is presented with some information about a particular book, including links to the google books page or an amazon search for that book.


Challenges implemented:
 * [x] Additional API (random word generator)
 * [x] Added link to safari webpages

Tested on iOS.

To simulate, you must first run "npm install" to install all the required node modules.
